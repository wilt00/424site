        I've been getting my weather from the iOS app "Dark Sky" for the last month or so. I use it mostly because it sends me a notification when it predicts that it is about to start raining where I am. It provides at the very top the current temperature, the "feels like" temperature (which is more useful), and a graphic representing current weather conditions (raining, overcast, etc.) It then shows a radar map and a graph showing predicted rainfall. This serves to highlight the information I am most interested in. Lower on the page it shows a graph showing the range of predicted temperatures for each of the next 7 days in a horizontal bar, with the width corresponding to the range between high and low temperatures; this is not intuitive at a glance and is less useful.
